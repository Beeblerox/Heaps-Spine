# Heaps-Spine
Spine player for Heaps framework. It is based on h2d.Graphics class.

You will need https://github.com/rainyt/OpenFLSpine to make it work (see example).

Currently it requires that all images of animation should be packed in one atlas (since each player can work only with one tile at a time)
